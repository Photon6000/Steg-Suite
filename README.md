# Steg-Suite Console 🕵️‍♂️🔓

**Steg-Suite Console** is a unified, cross-platform GUI designed to make complex command-line steganography tools accessible and easy to chain together.

Instead of memorizing dozens of flags for `zsteg`, `binwalk`, or `steghide`, this tool lets you simply speedrun through your CTF challenges (stego). Drag, drop, check the boxes, and let the suite handle the syntax.

# ❤️ Acknowledgments & Credits

**Steg-Suite Console** is a wrapper built on the shoulders of giants. This project would not exist without the incredible work of the security researchers and developers who created these core tools and open-sourced them for the world to use.

A massive **THANK YOU** to these creators for their dedication to the open-source community.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🛠️ All-in-One Toolbox:** Wraps `Binwalk`, `Zsteg`, `Steghide`, `Stegseek`, `ExifTool`, `Pngcheck`, `Jsteg`, `Stegsnow`, `Hashcat`, and `Hexdump`.
* **⛓️ Chain Attacks:** Select multiple tools and run them sequentially.
* **🖱️ Drag & Drop:** Load files instantly without typing paths.
* **🖥️ Cross-Platform:**
    * **Linux:** Full support.
    * **Windows:** (Experimental) Includes path configuration for `.exe` tools and a pure-Python fallback for `hexdump`.
* **⚙️ Smart Configuration:** Define custom paths for your tools via `config_application.txt`.
* **🧠 Intelligent Output:** Filters noise (like empty Zsteg lines) so you only see the flag/data.
* **🛑 Control:** Stop hanging processes instantly and save your logs.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Windows Support
Support for **Windows is currently experimental**. While the code handles `.exe` paths and platform-specific commands, steganography tools are natively designed for Linux. You may encounter bugs or setup hurdles on Windows.
